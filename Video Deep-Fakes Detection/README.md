# Chapter 6: Video Deep-Fakes Detection

## 6.2.1 Compilation of Image Datasets
Notebook used: [frame_extractor_dlib.ipynb](frame_extractor_dlib.ipynb)

We use dlib to detect and extract face images from videos. 
## 6.2.2 Experiment
Notebook used: [detection_fastai.ipynb](detection_fastai.ipynb)

We train and test the model on the single-frame Deep-Fakes datasets and observe the effect of Transfer Learning.
## 6.3.1 Compilation of Video Datasets
Notebook used: [frame_extractor_s_dlib_trainreal_30faces.ipynb](frame_extractor_s_dlib_trainreal_30faces.ipynb)

We use dlib to detect and extract face images from consecutive frames from videos.
## 6.3.3 Training
Notebook used: [td_cnn_lstm.ipynb](td_cnn_lstm.ipynb)

We train and compare the performance on Multi-Frame Deep-Fakes datasets of CNN and CNN+LSTM architectures.
