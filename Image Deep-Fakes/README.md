# Chapter 3: Image Deep-Fakes

## 3.1 Image Deep-Fakes Generation
Notebook used: [Image Deep-Fakes Generation.ipynb](Image%20Deep-Fakes%20Generation.ipynb)
### Synthetic Faces and Exploration of Latent Space
Code adapted from [Mikael Christensen](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ShgW6wohEFQtqs_znMna3dzrcVoABKIH), and [NVLabs](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan).
Refer to the work of [Denis Malimonov](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tg-bomze/StyleGAN2-Face-Modificator/blob/master/Face_Modificator_with_StyleGAN2_(Eng).ipynb) for getting latent vectors of custom images (real images) and then manipulating them.
## 3.2 Image Deep-Fakes Detection
Notebook used: [Image Deep-Fakes Detection.ipynb](Image%20Deep-Fakes%20Detection.ipynb)
### Detecting Synthetic Faces
Library used for backbone of detection pipeline is Fast AI. Refer to [documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/) for more information.
